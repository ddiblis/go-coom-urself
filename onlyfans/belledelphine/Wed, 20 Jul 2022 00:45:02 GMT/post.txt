Got my 10k steps in today! I have the watch that helps me keep track of my progress and its making working out so much better since i can now keep track of how well (or sometimes badly lol) i do ! I walked the wrong way today though and my white shoes got mega muddy… probably not a smart idea to wear white shoes in the woods, of course that would be something i’d do ahah
But isnt this photo of me by this door awesome?! Maybe i should paint my front door like this
