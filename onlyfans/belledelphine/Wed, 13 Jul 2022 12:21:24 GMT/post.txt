**Gooodmorrrningggg** 
I'm finally just getting over my sunburn and I'm so fricken -excited- not to be fricken INJURED anymore. I'm sorry that I'm so stupid, stupid stupid :&lt; I'm lil' and I still have mistakes to make but OH-mygawd not that again.. I have to protect myself with slimey white liquid... and by that I mean cu-.. sunscreen! 

But, it's okay! I'm okay, my ass wasn't touched by the sun *phew*. It's good to feel better and I'm *excited* to show off for u again.. I'm trying to think of what present I can give you for being patient and letting me heal :&gt; I'll have to cum up with something super nice.. I'll be around later to chat to you on here/messages &lt;3 

Here goes.. finally leaving the house again to.. u know.. mental health :&gt;
