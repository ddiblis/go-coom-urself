**hello and hi**
i totally did -not- fall asleep on the beach and burn myself, so I’m delivering my last sunny beach set while I lay in a pool of aloe vera and cold water for the next two days.. p l e a s e h e l p m e.

I literally always tell people about having sun cream on and I totally messed up ;&lt; 

I’m going to be stuck indoors over the next few days so I get to watch the rest of Stranger things and the boys which is great as I’m so near the end of it ☺️ p.s spoil it and I will k i l l you

Whats the worst you’ve been burnt? Make me feel not alone and like -someoneee- has burnt worse than this ;(
